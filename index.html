        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am an 19 year old student aspiring to grow in the software industry. I moved here from Lebanon when I was 10 years old, so I grew up speaking three languages. During my second year, I was given the opportunity to become a coding instructor. I was fortunate enough to work with intelligent kids that would often teach me new things as well. From this experience, I was able to dive into robotics and incorporate programming in video game development. I am also a team leader at my second job where I became in charge of the store and was responsible for every worker during my shift, assigned tasks to each member, and ordered and managed produce for the store. I aspire to become a part of the engineers that shape the technology of the future. </p>
